# REST
## Options

### Trades

**Endpoint:** `GET /v3/trades/{optionsTicker}`

**Description:**

Retrieve comprehensive, tick-level trade data for a specified options ticker within a defined time range. Each record includes price, size, exchange, trade conditions, and precise timestamp information. This granular data is foundational for constructing aggregated bars and performing in-depth analyses, as it captures every eligible trade that contributes to calculations of open, high, low, and close (OHLC) values. By leveraging these trades, users can refine their understanding of intraday price movements, test and optimize algorithmic strategies, and ensure compliance by maintaining an auditable record of market activity.

Use Cases: Intraday analysis, algorithmic trading, market microstructure research, data integrity and compliance.
